# Exercise 02

1. Take the `iris` dataset. Using `Species` as the indicator variable, convert the wide dataset to long such that it appears as below:

```
  Species     variable value
1  setosa Sepal.Length   5.1
2  setosa Sepal.Length   4.9
3  setosa Sepal.Length   4.7
4  setosa Sepal.Length   4.6
5  setosa Sepal.Length   5.0
6  setosa Sepal.Length   5.4
```

2.
Note: This is a hard problem. Work with your neighbor if need be. 

Save this dataset to disk as "species1.csv". Duplicate the previous function call and save it again as "species2.csv"

Write code that does the following:

* Reads all file names in your working directory with a `.csv` extension
* Treating that as a list, run the `read.csv` function on each item so you get a list of size 2 that contains all the data.

3. With the list from the previous result, write a `lappy or llply` function call that will retrieve row number 1 from each dataset and return that back to a list.
