# Using the split-apply strategy to manipulate data

Groupwise operations - The plyr package provides an elegant way to extract complicated information from any data set. Most data manipulation tasks can be reduced to a core set of actions. plyr provides an easy to learn interface for these actions. We’ll show you how to mine a data set for its hidden gems, with plyr’s’ consistent, purposefully-designed workflow. In this module, you will

> Learn the four basic verbs of data manipulation: 

* `subset`
* `mutate`
* `summarise`
*  and `arrange`
*
