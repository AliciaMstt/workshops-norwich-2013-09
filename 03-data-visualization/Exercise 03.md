# Data visualization exercise

Please write two functions that can take the following arguments:

* input dataset
* plot title

and generate a `ggplot2` similar to what you did for the climate anomaly earlier.

# Hint

Either use the `...` option or explicitly pass the title as an argument in the function to the `ggplot()` call.
